## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is this and what was this built for?

Datum is a cross-chain permissionless oracle protocol for your smart contracts built on top of Optimism's newly created OP stack chains and Superchain.

Smart Contracts needs Off-Chain data to build useful applications and data availability is an integral part of any Op stack Chain. With DATUM , now you can get off chain data from Chainlink and UMA oracles straight to your chains in seconds and minimal setup of Oracle Nodes.

## 🤔 Why Datum ?

Rollups are the best Ethereum Scaling Solutions , and now with Optimism's OP Stack to fire up a new rollup for your dApp , so what's better then creating infrastructure for these L2s.

It is permissionless , meaning anybody can start the Oracles on their own new chain , in just a few steps.

There are endless possiblities of dApps which can be built with the help of Data provided from oracles like Predictions Markets , Insurance Claims , DEFI Appilcations and a lot more.

### ☄️ What's next?

New type of Oracles will be added and we also want to explore an automation service like Chainlink Automation , which make Smart Contracts More Smart.
